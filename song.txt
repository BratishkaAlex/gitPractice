album: Atlas
song: Wild Eyes

We built our dreams from the ashes of your nightmares
Carried our father's sins, from the cradle to the grave
We paved our paths through the darkness that you left us in
Now we ride in the belly of the beast
We are the diamonds that choose to stay coal
A generation born to witness the end of the world

Against the grain
Against the odds
Against the world
Forever the underdogs

We are the bastard sons.
We are the ones that refuse to grow cold
We are the thorn in your side
We are the thieves in the night
And we're coming to take what's ours

No regrets
We inherit the sins of the fathers, now reap the vengeance

From the ashes of your nightmares
From the cradle to our grave
We blazed our path through the darkness that you left us in
Now we ride in the belly of the beast
We are the diamonds that choose to stay coal
A generation born to witness the end of the world

Born to witness the end of the world

Viva the underdogs
